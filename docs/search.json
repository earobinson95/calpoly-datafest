    "text": "Getting Started with Software\nYou are welcome to use any coding language you like at DataFest. Below are tips for getting started with a couple we recommend.\n\nR/RStudio\nDownload and run the R installer for your operating system from CRAN:\n\nWindows: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/\nMac: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/\nLinux: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ (pick your distribution)\n\nIf you are on Windows, you should also install the Rtools4 package; this will ensure you get fewer warnings later when installing packages.\nMore detailed instructions for Windows are available here\nDownload and install the latest version of RStudio for your operating system. RStudio is a integrated development environment (IDE) for R, created by Posit. It contains a set of tools designed to make writing R, python, javascript, and other data-related code easier.\n\n\nPython\nDownload and install the latest version of python 3\n\nWindows: check the box that asks if you want to add Python to the system path. This will save you a lot of time and frustration. If you didn’t do this, you can follow these instructions to fix the issue (you’ll need to restart your machine).\nIf you’re interested in python, you should install Jupyter using the instructions here (I would just do pip3 install jupyterlab).\nAdditional instructions for installing Python 3 from Python for Everybody if you have trouble.\n\n\n\n\nComputing Resources\n\nStatistical Computing using R and Python by Susan VanderPlas\nR4DS\n\n\n\nDataFest Workshops\nWe hope to work with the Statistics and Data Science clubs to organize workshops focused on data management and visualization, getting started with the data, and giving effective presentations to prepare you for the weekend event.\nThese will be held during UU hour during winter quarter. Check back for updates."

    "text": "What is a DataFest Mentor?\nDuring the event, we have faculty, graduate students, and industry experts walk around to talk with the teams about their progress. You do not need to be an expert in the topic or in statistics, but your responsibility is to prompt the team with questions to get them to think critically about the data.\nWhat question are they trying to answer? What action are they recommending is taken? Who is their audience? Are their graphs and results interpretable in context?\nWe will have windows of time blocks from Friday evening through Sunday morning for mentoring sign up.\n\n\nServing as a DataFest Judge\nWe would not be able to run DataFest without a panel of judges! DataFest is a 48-hour data marathon where students collaborate on teams to investigate a complex data set. The event culminates with 5-minute (3-slide) team presentations in which a panel of about four judges award three prize categories – Best in Show, Best Visualization, and Best Use of Outside Data.\nThe presentation and judging takes place on Sunday afternoon. Our goal is to bring in judges with a variety of backgrounds, and we would love to connect if you are interested!\nPlease note we have funding for a one night hotel stay if you are traveling from the Bay or LA area.\n\n\nInterested?\nAre you or someone you know interested in serving as a mentor or judge for ASA DataFest 2025 (April xx) at Cal Poly?

    "text": "How big are teams?\nWhile teams can be between 2-5 individuals, teams with 4-5 individuals will be given priority over teams with fewer. If you have a team of 3 and there is an individual without a team, they may be added to your team at last minute.\n\n\n What if I don’t have a team?\nWe will send out an interest form before official team sign up and do our best to connect you with other students who are looking to form a team. Additionally, we will hold a DataFest Social Mixer where you can come learn more about DataFest and chat with other potential teammates.\n\n\n When will we find out about the data?\nThe data and context is released during DataFest Kickoff on Friday at 5pm of the event weekend. It is kept secret until then!\n\n\n Can we work overnight?\nThe official work space will close at 10 p.m., but you are welcome to find a space in the campus union or library to work overnight. The official work space will open again the next morning at 8 a.m. All work MUST be completed on Cal Poly premises.\n\n\n What is the final deliverable?\nEach team will have 5 minutes to present their findings to a panel of three judges.\nEach team will be allowed at most three slides. Three. So at some point on Sunday, you might want to set aside time to think about what you want the judges to know. The 5 minute time limit will be strictly enforced. All team members must be present for the presentation, but not all team members need to actually speak (given the time limitation).\nAwards will be given in three categories:\n\nBest in Show: This is the main prize.\nBest Visualization\nBest Use of Outside Data\n\nWinners will receive mini trophies with the event and award name as well as a free ASA membership.\nWhile there is a judging and award portion of this event, we encourage a fun and friendly environment for all to learn!\n\n\n Are you accepting teams from other institutions?\nWe do not currently have a mechanism in place to host other teams at Cal Poly for DataFest. Our pipe dream is in the next few years to expand to a Central Coast DataFest. If your institution is interested in working with us to make this happen, please contact us at statisticsdepartment@calpoly.edu."

    "text": "What is DataFest?\nDataFest is a national event organized by the American Statistical Association as a celebration of data in which teams of undergraduates work around the clock to find and share meaning in a large, rich, and complex data set. The ASA provides a data set to participating institutions in which local DataFests are held across the country during March and April each year.\n Intense Collaboration: Teams of 2-5 undergraduates engage in a 48-hour data analysis marathon, working to decipher a complex data set and craft insightful solutions.\n Innovation and Camaraderie: Participants are fueled by a spirit of innovation and teamwork, pushing the boundaries of data exploration while fostering a supportive and collaborative environment.\n Showcasing Discoveries: The event culminates in 5-minute presentations where teams share their findings and insights. Awards are given for the Best in Show, Best Visualization, and Best Use of Outside Data.\nLearn more at https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/.\n\n\n Important Dates @ Cal Poly\n\n\n\nItem\nDate\n\n\n\n\nStudent Interest Survey\nDue March TBD\n\n\nDataFest Social Mixer\nMarch TBD at x:xx in TBD\n\n\nOfficial Student Team Sign-up\nDue March TBD\n\n\nDataFest 2025 Weekend!\nApril 4 - 6, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n Contact\nDr. Emily Robinson, Assistant Professor of Statistics\n erobin17@calpoly.edu\n\nDepartment of Statistics, Cal Poly - SLO\n statisticsdepartment@calpoly.edu"
