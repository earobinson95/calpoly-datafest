### Getting Started with Software

You are welcome to use any coding language you like at DataFest. Below are tips for getting started with a couple we recommend.

#### R/RStudio

Download and run the R installer for your operating system from CRAN:

 + Windows: <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/>
 + Mac: <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/>
 + Linux: <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/> (pick your distribution)

If you are on  Windows, you should also install the [Rtools4 package](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/); this will ensure you get fewer warnings later when installing packages.

More detailed instructions for  Windows are available [here](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/training-curriculum/installr/)

Download and install the [latest version of RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download) for your operating system. RStudio is a integrated development environment (IDE) for R, created by Posit. It contains a set of tools designed to make writing R, python, javascript, and other data-related code easier.

#### Python

Download and install the latest version of [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

+ Windows: check the box that asks if you want to add Python to the system path. This will save you a lot of time and frustration. If you didn’t do this, you can follow [these instructions](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/) to fix the issue (you’ll need to restart your machine).
+ If you’re interested in python, you should install Jupyter using the instructions here (I would just do pip3 install jupyterlab).
