# `r fa("chart-line")` What is DataFest?

DataFest is a national event organized by the American Statistical Association as a celebration of data in which teams of undergraduates work around the clock to find and share meaning in a large, rich, and complex data set. The ASA provides a data set to participating institutions in which local DataFests are held across the country during March and April each year.

`r fa("users")` **Intense Collaboration:** Teams of 2-5 undergraduates engage in a 48-hour data analysis marathon, working to decipher a complex data set and craft insightful solutions.

`r fa("lightbulb")` **Innovation and Camaraderie:** Participants are fueled by a spirit of innovation and teamwork, pushing the boundaries of data exploration while fostering a supportive and collaborative environment.

`r fa("trophy")` **Showcasing Discoveries:** The event culminates in 5-minute presentations where teams share their findings and insights. Awards are given for the Best in Show, Best Visualization, and Best Use of Outside Data.
