### `r fa("question")` How big are teams?

While teams can be between 2-5 individuals, teams with 4-5 individuals will be given priority over teams with fewer. If you have a team of 3 and there is an individual without a team, they may be added to your team at last minute.

### `r fa("question")` What if I don't have a team?

We will send out an interest form before official team sign up and do our best to connect you with other students who are looking to form a team. Additionally, we will hold a DataFest Social Mixer where you can come learn more about DataFest and chat with other potential teammates.

### `r fa("question")` When will we find out about the data?

The data and context is released during DataFest Kickoff on Friday at 5pm of the event weekend. It is kept secret until then!

### `r fa("question")` Can we work overnight?

The official work space will close at 10 p.m., but you are welcome to find a space in the campus union or library to work overnight. The official work space will open again the next morning at 8 a.m. All work MUST be completed on Cal Poly premises.

### `r fa("question")` What is the final deliverable?

Each team will have 5 minutes to present their findings to a panel of three judges. 

Each team will be allowed at most three slides. **Three.** So at some point on Sunday,
you might want to set aside time to think about what you want the judges to know. The 5
minute time limit will be strictly enforced. All team members must be present for the
presentation, but not all team members need to actually speak (given the time limitation).

Awards will be given in three categories:

+ Best in Show: This is the main prize.
+ Best Visualization
+ Best Use of Outside Data

Winners will receive mini trophies with the event and award name as well as a free ASA
membership.

While there is a judging and award portion of this event, we encourage a fun and friendly environment for all to learn!

### `r fa("question")` Are you accepting teams from other institutions?

We do not currently have a mechanism in place to host other teams at Cal Poly for DataFest. Our pipe dream is in the next few years to expand to a Central Coast DataFest. If your institution is interested in working with us to make this happen, please contact us at statisticsdepartment@calpoly.edu.
