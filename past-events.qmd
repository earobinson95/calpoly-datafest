A total of 76 undergraduate students participated in a weekend of visualizing, summarizing, and analyzing data. Students participated from across three colleges including: mostly Statistics & Data Science major in the Bailey College of Science and Technology, a couple of handfuls of Computer Science and Software Engineering majors in the College of Engineering, and a student from Public Health in the School of Liberal Arts. We also welcomed two amazing teams from CSU-Monterey Bay down for the weekend.
