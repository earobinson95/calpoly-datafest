    "text": "How big are teams?\nWhile teams can be between 2-5 individuals, teams with 4-5 individuals will be given priority over teams with fewer. If you have a team of 3 and there is an individual without a team, they may be added to your team at last minute.\n\n\n What if I don’t have a team?\nWe will send out an interest form before official team sign up and do our best to connect you with other students who are looking to form a team. Additionally, we will hold a DataFest Social Mixer where you can come learn more about DataFest and chat with other potential teammates.\n\n\n When will we find out about the data?\nThe data and context is released during DataFest Kickoff on Friday at 5pm of the event weekend. It is kept secret until then!\n\n\n Can we work overnight?\nThe official work space will close at 10 p.m., but you are welcome to find a space in the campus union or library to work overnight. The official work space will open again the next morning at 8 a.m. All work MUST be completed on Cal Poly premises.\n\n\n What is the final deliverable?\nEach team will have 5 minutes to present their findings to a panel of three judges.\nEach team will be allowed at most three slides. Three. So at some point on Sunday, you might want to set aside time to think about what you want the judges to know. The 5 minute time limit will be strictly enforced. All team members must be present for the presentation, but not all team members need to actually speak (given the time limitation).\nAwards will be given in three categories:\n\nBest in Show: This is the main prize.\nBest Visualization\nBest Use of Outside Data\n\nWinners will receive mini trophies with the event and award name as well as a free ASA membership.\nWhile there is a judging and award portion of this event, we encourage a fun and friendly environment for all to learn!\n\n\n Are you accepting teams from other institutions?\nWe do not currently have a mechanism in place to host other teams at Cal Poly for DataFest. Our pipe dream is in the next few years to expand to a Central Coast DataFest. If your institution is interested in working with us to make this happen, please contact us at statisticsdepartment@calpoly.edu."

    "text": "What is DataFest?\nDataFest is a national event organized by the American Statistical Association as a celebration of data in which teams of undergraduates work around the clock to find and share meaning in a large, rich, and complex data set. The ASA provides a data set to participating institutions in which local DataFests are held across the country during March and April each year.\n Intense Collaboration: Teams of 2-5 undergraduates engage in a 48-hour data analysis marathon, working to decipher a complex data set and craft insightful solutions.\n Innovation and Camaraderie: Participants are fueled by a spirit of innovation and teamwork, pushing the boundaries of data exploration while fostering a supportive and collaborative environment.\n Showcasing Discoveries: The event culminates in 5-minute presentations where teams share their findings and insights. Awards are given for the Best in Show, Best Visualization, and Best Use of Outside Data.\nLearn more at https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/.\n\n\n Important Dates @ Cal Poly\n\n\n\nItem\nDate\n\n\n\n\nStudent Interest Survey\nDue March xx\n\n\nDataFest Social Mixer\nMarch xx at x:xx in xxx\n\n\nOfficial Student Team Sign-up\nDue March xx\n\n\nDataFest 2025 Weekend!\nApril xx - April xx\n\n\n\n\n\n Contact\nDr. Emily Robinson, Assistant Professor of Statistics\n erobin17@calpoly.edu\n\nDepartment of Statistics, Cal Poly - SLO\n statisticsdepartment@calpoly.edu"
